## 2025-05-14 - [Confirmation Dialog for Destructive Actions]
**Learning:** In a local-first application where data is stored in localStorage, accidental deletion is a high-risk event because there is no easy server-side restore. Adding a confirmation dialog for folder deletion is a critical UX safeguard that aligns with the "Palette" philosophy of making interaction feel smooth and safe.
**Action:** Always implement confirmation steps or "undo" patterns for destructive actions in local-first apps to maintain user trust and prevent data loss.

**Learning:** In a minimalist or technical UI (like the "Industrial" theme), empty states can easily feel like "dead ends" if they only contain static text. Adding a prominent, themed CTA button (e.g., using a dashed border for a "placeholder" look) significantly improves the onboarding experience and makes the next logical step unambiguous.
**Action:** Always accompany empty state messages with a direct call-to-action button that triggers the primary intended interaction for that view.
