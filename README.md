# Deezer Album Organizer (GitHub Pages)

A static, local-first album organizer for Deezer fans. Search for albums, place them into folders, and keep everything stored in your browser so the site can be hosted publicly with no authentication gate.

## Features
- Search Deezer albums and add them to folders.
- Local-first storage (data lives in your browser).
- Static export-ready for GitHub Pages.

## Run locally
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Build for GitHub Pages

pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Notes
- The app is static and does not require a backend.
- All user data remains local to the browser, so it is safe to host publicly.
